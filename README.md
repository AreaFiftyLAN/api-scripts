#Scripts for the lancie-api
This repository contains all kinds of handy functions to use on the [lancie-api](https://github.com/AreaFiftyLAN/lancie-api). All actions that alter data in the api have a confirmation check built in.

##Usage
To use the script, you will need [python3.5](https://www.python.org/). The main file can be executed with the command `python3.5 main`. You can also make the file executable in Linux and OSX by using the `chmod +x main` command.

##Config
The script uses a config file which is located under `./config/config`. A template file can be found in the `./config` folder.
